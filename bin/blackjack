  #This Shell Script ./bin/blackjack file works for running the blackjack game by setting a variable
  # game_home and then executing Ruby over the script lib/blackjack.rb This means the developer
  # no longer has to go into the shell and actively type in the command
  #   -I./lib lib/blackjack.rb
